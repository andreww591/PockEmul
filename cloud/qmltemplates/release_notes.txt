QML Templates
=============

The QML UI Templates Library will provide commonly used UI components for 
generic use with QML. This library is not meant to replace the official Qt 
Components project, but to provide larger templates for developers to take a 
look and utilise in their own projects. 

The UI Templates Library contains reusable UI elements and templates used in 
the example applications RSSReader Example, Restaurant Application Example 
and the MediaBrowser Example. 

They are aimed to be the basic building blocks of QML applications focusing on 
the UI. They are not only elementary UI components, like buttons or switches, 
but rather more comprehensive templates like four views with tab navigation 
bar or a list view + details view integrated, or a flickable path view for 
browsing photos. 

The style and graphics used in these elements are based on a uniform style, 
which can be re-used in your own applications as you wish. The elements can 
also be easily customised with different colors, styles, and graphics 
according to your requirements.
